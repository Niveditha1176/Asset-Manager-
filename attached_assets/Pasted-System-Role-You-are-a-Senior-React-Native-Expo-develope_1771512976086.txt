System Role: You are a Senior React Native / Expo developer.
Task: Build a high-fidelity frontend prototype for an urban logistics Driver App based on handwritten UI sketches.
Color Palette: Professional and Neutral—Primary Blue (#2563EB), White (#FFFFFF), and Light Grey (#F3F4F6).

Core Components to Build:

Multi-State Homepage:

Pre-Delivery (Home): A dashboard showing the driver's name, a "Request Fuel/Break" toggle, and a categorized task list: "En Route" (expandable order details), "Upcoming" (scrollable cards), and "Past Completed" (greyed out).

En Route (Map View): A large map area with a floating "Voice Bot" bubble. Below the map, a sliding bottom sheet with Order Details (Customer name, Address, ETA, Time Window, and Package ID). Include a persistent sidebar for Profile, Settings, Notifications, and Logout.

Compliance & Event Reporting:

Post-Delivery Flow: Once a location is reached, show a screen with a "Delivery Proof" upload button and a "Report Exception" dropdown.

Exception Reporting: Provide specific buttons/options for "Road Blocked," "Customer Not Home," "Return to Origin," and "Other" with a text field and photo proof option.

Fuel Logging: A "Fuel Stop Reached" screen with two upload placeholders: "Bunk Meter Photo" and "Payment Screenshot".

HR & Operations (Forms):

Leave Application: A form with a calendar date picker, a reason dropdown, and a "Generate Ticket" button.

Overtime Management: A form for "Hours Requested" (From/To time) and a "Request Overtime" button.

Notification Center: A list of expandable alerts from the Dispatcher. Implement a "Swipe to Delete/Acknowledge" gesture for each notification.

Dynamic Interactions (Mocked):

Voice Bot: Place a circular floating action button (FAB) with a microphone icon on all main screens.

Fuel Needed Logic: Include a "FUEL NEEDED" button. When clicked, it should simulate a status update to the dispatcher and visually insert a "Mock Fuel Stop" marker into the map route.

Technical Requirements:

Use Lucide-React for icons (Truck, Map, User, Fuel).

Use Mock Data for the delivery sequence and notification list.

Implement React Navigation (Bottom Tabs or Stack) to move between the Task List, Map View, and Forms.

Ensure the UI matches the "human-like" navigation USP mentioned in the notes.
